	<h1>The Constitution</h1>

	<p>
		When is the last time you actually read the Constitution?  When I say read I don’t mean you heard it in school when you were a kid, I mean word by word for yourself.
		<br />
		<a href="http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/constitution.html" target="_blank">Read the Constitution now</a>.
	</p>

	<p>
		I suggest you read it with your family, along with the <a href="http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/declaration.html" target="_blank">Declaration of Independence</a>, at least once a year.  I like to read them annually on the 4th of July.
	</p>

	<h2>What is separation of Church and State?</h2>
	<p>
		The separation of church and state is a good thing for both the church and the state.  It works by protecting the churches from having the government stay out so they can have freedom of religion.  It also protects everyone from the government adopting a state religion.
	</p>

	<h2>Where it is <em>not</em> stated? </h2>
	<p>
		No where in any of the founding documents of our country does it ever say “separation of church and state”.  What it does say about religion is:
	</p>
	<blockquote>
		"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof...."
		<cite><a href="http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/bill_of_rights_transcript.html" target="_blank">Bill of Rights</a></cite>
	</blockquote>

	<h2>Where it <em>is</em> stated?</h2>
	<p>
		In a  <a href="http://www.loc.gov/loc/lcib/9806/danpre.html" target="_blank">personal letter from Thomas Jefferson to the Danbury Baptists</a>.
	</p>

	<h2>Why do people think the phrase “separation of Church and State” it is in the Constitution?</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>The first reason is because the Supreme Court has interpreted the Constitution to include that phrase.</li>
		<li>And the second reason is because no one reads the Constitution anymore.</li>
	</ol>

	<h2>What is Church?</h2>
	<p>
		Church and God are not the same thing; Church is how people worship God.
	</p>

	<h2>What it <em>does</em> mean?</h2>
	<p>
		The government should not control religion, so we can have our Constitutional right of Freedom of Religion.  And it also means that religion does not control the government so we don’t have a state religion.
	</p>

	<h2>What it <em>doesn’t</em> mean?</h2>
	<p>
		It doesn’t mean that any mention of God, religion, or morals is unconstitutional.  To mention God, religion, or morals, even in a government building, is freedom of religion, which is a constitutional right.  Our currency carries our motto "In God We Trust".  The Declaration of Independence mentions God. Congress still begins its sessions with prayer,
		and the phrase, "under God" was <a href="http://www.post-gazette.com/nation/20020628undergod0628p3.asp" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> added to the Pledge of Allegiance</a>.
		<br />
		Obviously God is a part of our Country.
	</p>
	<p>
		Separation of Church and State does not mean separation of God and State.
	</p>
	<p>
		A belief in God does not equal religion or church.  Many non-church groups have a belief in God like the Shriners, the Boy Scouts of America, Alcoholics Anonymous, the US military, and our own Country.
	</p>
	<p>
		A belief in God does not interfere with the free exercise of religion, and does not make a law respecting an establishment of religion.
	</p>
	<p>
		A belief in God does not interfere with the separation of church and state, since God is a part of them both.
	</p>

	<div class="Content_Image_Right"><img src="http://blzaugg.github.io/thewaronignoranceorg//images/content/Church-and-State.gif" alt="" /></div>

	<p>
		The separation of church and state was <em>not</em> created to keep the church away from the state as if it were the plague.
	</p>

	<p>
		Our great country was built on the foundation of God and morals, and what will happen if we try to remove that?
	</p>

	<p>
		Imagine you spend your whole life building a home for your children to live in and enjoy, when you finally die some of your children start removing the foundation, because they don’t agree with it.  Did you not explain to them the principles of architecture that if you remove the foundation, the structure will fall?  Your other children still live in that house built by their forefathers and will not allow anyone to destroy it!  If they don’t want God, then they can live with it or they can move to another house.  God bless America!
	</p>

	<p>
		We created the constitution to prevent our country from having a state religion, because if one religion is chosen above another then the other religions won’t have any freedom.
	</p>

	<p>
		Unfortunately we now have a state religion; it’s called “Political Correctness”.  This new state religion is beginning to take away our true Constitutional rights of freedom of worship, and the freedom of speech.
		<br />
		This new state religion has also outlawed God and morals and has replaced them with new pseudo morals.  New definitions of what is right and good.
	</p>

	<p>
		Just as in the book “Animal Farm” the rules listed on the barn are beginning to change.  This change will start a division.  The time has come to ask yourself a question, what side will you stand on?
