	<h1>The War on Ignorance</h1>

	<h2>Introduction</h2>

	<p>
		Let me start out by saying I’m not perfect and this
		website isn’t perfect either. It is a work in
		progress.  If you have suggestions or comments for
		this website feel free to e-mail me at
		<span class="Email">Dr_Zog [at] msn [dot] com</span>
	</p>

	<p>
		My goal with this website is to teach people how
		to liberate minds through knowledge.  This
		website is not intended to be a source of
		knowledge but instead provides advice on ways to
		obtain it.
	</p>

	<p>
		We are at a time in history when the most
		information is available to us, and yet it seems
		to be the time in history when we are also the
		most ignorant, why?  It’s like growing up being a
		spoiled little kid.  When things are freely
		handed to you with no effort on your own, we tend
		to take it for granted.
	</p>

	<p>
		I’ve noticed at least four things that can
		destroy our society if not remedied: our
		ignorance about personal nutrition, finance,
		other religions, and the Constitution.  This
		website will address these issues.
	</p>

	<h2>Take Responsibility</h2>

	<p>
		We love to place the blame for our problems, but
		pointing fingers won’t help you or change the
		world.  First we need to recognize that we are
		ignorant and second we need to change it.
	</p>

	<p>
		The only person we can blame is ourselves and
		the only person we can change is ourselves.  You
		can influence others, but you cannot control
		people and you shouldn’t.  Have more faith in
		yourself to solve your own problems.  You can do it!
	</p>

	<p>
		Where society started to fail was in the home,
		so let’s start there to fix the problem.  The
		best way to teach your children is through our
		example, which means we need to change first.
	</p>

	<h2>Be Open Minded</h2>

	<p>
		Learn to be objective.  Agree to disagree; you
		don’t have to accept something to understand it.
		<br />
		People fear what they don’t understand, not
		understanding is ignorance, and ignorance and
		fear create prejudice, and hate.
	</p>

	<p>
		In Paul Simon’s words from the lyrics of The
		Boxer, <em>“A man hears what he wants to hear and
		disregards the rest.”</em>  We have to ask ourselves,
		“Do we research things to find the ultimate truth,
		or do we do it to find what supports our own
		conclusions?”  Remember that truth is independent
		of man and will prevail when man is objective.
	</p>

	<h2>Be Optimistic</h2>

	<p>
		The world is not getting worst, it’s dividing.
		What we need to focus on is what we can do to
		remove ourselves from the painful dividing
		process.  The answer is simple, take a side.
		<br />
		Is the glass half full or half empty?  The bad
		things in this world are getting worst, but the
		good things in this world are getting better.
		Look at all the wonderful, good things in the
		world.  I absolutely love all the new and
		exciting technology.  Advancements in medicine
		and computers has literally made the world a
		better place.  Don’t lose hope, work to make
		things better.
	</p>

	<h2>Balance and Perspective</h2>

	<p>
		There are many distractions in the world, even
		good ones.  Don’t allow one extreme path to
		dominate your life; try to view the world from
		many angles.
	</p>

	<h2>War Does Not Equal Violence</h2>

	<blockquote>
		“For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but
		against principalities, against powers, against
		the rulers of the darkness of this world, against
		spiritual wickedness in high places.”
		<cite>New Testament | Ephesians 6:12</cite>
	</blockquote>

	<p>
		The only kind of war that can bring world peace
		is a war without blood.  The war on ignorance is
		major part of that war.  Let the ink flow
		instead of the blood.
	</p>

	<h2>Conclusion</h2>

	<p>
		The search for truth is a search in all things:
		all religions, organizations, science,
		philosophy, individuals, and even in fiction.
	</p>

	<p>
		The internet can be one of the greatest tools in
		the war on ignorance.  However, like any tool it
		can be used to do good or to do harm.  Use it
		wisely.
	</p>

	<p>
		I personally love <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/" target="_blank">www.wikipedia.org</a> not as the
		source of truth but as a means to find it.
		Remember references are what bring validity to
		information.

		Just because you
		heard it on the news, or had it forwarded from
		your brother on an e-mail, doesn’t make it true.
